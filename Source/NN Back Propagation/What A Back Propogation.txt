What A Back Propagation?
Read That:):

Back-propagation is the essence of neural net training. 
It is the practice of fine-tuning the weights of a neural net based on the error rate (i.e. loss) obtained in the previous epoch (i.e. iteration). 
Proper tuning of the weights ensures lower error rates, making the model reliable by increasing its generalization.
