What A XOR Problem?
Read That:):

An XOR (exclusive OR gate) is a digital logic gate that gives a true output only when both its inputs differ from each other. 
The truth table for an XOR gate is shown below: Truth Table for XOR. 
The goal of the neural network is to classify the input patterns according to the above truth table.
