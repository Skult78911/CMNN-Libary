# What at a CMNN Libary?
-----
CMNN Libary - Is A Simple Python Libary Of Nerual Network. But To Work With This Libary You Need To Know About Nerual (NN) Netowrks And Also About Machine Learning
(ML). This Is Open Source Libary. But This Libary Coulnd't Installed By Pip Command In Cmd (Command Promt) Because This Is A Private Libary And Don't Be Used On
Different Projects. You Only Can To Work With This Libary On This Project (Like Source Code). 


# How To Use CMNN Libary?
---
This Libary Have A Source Code Where You Can Do What You Want. But This Libary For Neural Netowrks. It's Very Simple To Use Because Source Code Have A Comments.
With Comments You Can Learn Whats Happening With Code :). Also Source Code Get Grupped To Make Easy To Find What You Want To Find In This Libary. All Scripts
In This Source Have A .txt Files Lol. In This .txt Files You Can Learn About A Nerual Networks.

# Can CMNN Libary Is Used In More Big Projects?
---
If You Very Good Know About This 3 Punkts (This Is A NN(Neural Netowrk), ML(Machine Learning) And Python Programming Language) You Can Create A Project With This 
Libary. But This Libary Is Have Small Functional Now. But In Soon This Libary Get More New Functions. So Actually This Libary Can Be Used In More Big Projects.

# CMNN Libary Can Be Used In Old Python Versions?
--- 
Actualy Yes But you Get Many Errors. I'm Recommend To Use The Python Version 3.8.5 And Biggest. Why Version 3.8.5? Because This Libary Writed In This Version In 
Python. But If You Genius Of Python You Maybe Can Fix The Problems. But I'm Not Recommend To Use Oldest Python Version For Libary.
